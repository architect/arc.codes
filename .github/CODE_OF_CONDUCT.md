# Architect Code of Conduct

We are strongly committed to ensuring the Architect community, and the various online and offline spaces in which its members congregate and collaborate, are safe, positive, inclusive, constructive, and welcoming environments.

As such, the Architect project adheres to the [OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which itself adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org).

Lack of familiarity with this or the OpenJS Foundation Codes of Conduct, or the Contributor covenant, is not an excuse for non-adherence.

## Reporting

If you are the subject of any behavior prohibited by this Code of Conduct, or observe someone who is, please contact an Architect team member immediately.

If you know an Architect team member, you may wish to contact them personally (and you should); but if not, please [contact us via email](mailto:conduct@arc.codes).

If possible, please attempt to collect any relevant information and evidence, including links, screenshots, or other recordings of any incident.

Reports will be handled with the utmost care, confidence, and sensitivity towards the individual(s) reporting.

## Enforcement

Should incidents arise, upon adjudication those found to be in violation of this Code of Conduct may be immediately expelled from the Architect community, including events, forums, chat workspaces, code repositories, and any other place where Architect community members collaborate.
