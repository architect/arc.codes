---

The Architect team has a strong interest in [Deno](https://deno.land/) as a runtime. Ideally, Deno would be supported both locally with Sandbox and in live infrastructure on AWS.

* Track [runtime helper](https://github.com/architect/functions-deno) progress.
* Join the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/architect/architect/discussions) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/y5A2eTsCRX).

Contributions are always welcome!
