description: Define DynamoDB table global secondary indexes.
---

Defines [Global Secondary Indexes][gsi] for your project's [DynamoDB][ddb] tables. `@tables-indexes` should only ever be paired with [`@tables`][tables].

> ℹ️  As of Architect v9.4, `@tables-indexes` should be used in place of `@indexes`. `@indexes` will be superseded in a future Arc release.

## Recommended Resources

[DynamoDB][ddb] is a powerful database, though different from both SQL and NoSQL databases. It is highly recommended to dig into Amazon's resources to familiarize yourself with it:

- [DynamoDB Core Components (start here!)][core]
- [Global Secondary Indexes in DynamoDB][gsi]
- [Amazon's full DynamoDB documentation][ddb]

## Syntax

- `@tables-indexes` is a feature subset of [`@tables`][tables]; as such, the names of your declared indexes must match those of your [`@tables`][tables]
- AWS supports a maximum of 20 indexes per table
- Otherwise, the basic syntax for defining `@tables-indexes` primary keys is the same as [`@tables`][tables]:
  - Partition key, defined by a `*`, is required
  - Sort key, defined by `**`, is optional
  - Currently only `*String`, `**String`, `*Number` and `**Number` are supported
- An optional `name` property can be provided to explicitly name the index. This is helpful when [querying the index with the AWS SDK as you know what to pass to the `IndexName` query parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/DynamoDB/DocumentClient.html#query-property)
- An optional `projection` property can be provided to explicitly define which [item attributes get projected][projection], or included, in query results. By default, Arc will project _all_ item attributes (the `ALL` projection type as described in the [DynamoDB documentation on attribute projections][projection])
  - Customizing which attributes to project can be helpful when trying to save on [storage costs][pricing]
  - Note that once a projection is defined, it cannot be changed; a new index would need to be created
  - Acceptable values for `projection` are:
    - `all` (default): all item attributes from the table are projected into the index
    - `keys`: only the base table and index primary keys (and sort keys, if defined) are projected into the index
    - Custom: otherwise, you may define one or more attribute names to explicitly project into the index. Note that the base table and index keys always get projected

## Deployment Considerations

⚠️ Be careful when [`arc deploy`](../cli/deploy) indexes! There are a few unique CloudFormation behaviors that happen behind the scenes that you should be aware of, please see the [Important note on the CloudFormation reference page for Global Secondary Indexes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.html#cfn-dynamodb-table-globalsecondaryindexes). In particular:

- Creating a new index on an existing table can take time. While the index is being populated, you cannot update the table or use the index. Furthermore, CloudFormation will not block while the index is populating, so you should keep tabs on its state after creation.
- CloudFormation generally does not support index updating, aside from a few specific properties.
- You can only add or delete one index in each deploy.

Given the above, it's generally recommended to silo application updates to just the bare minimum when working with indexes.

## Example

The following `app.arc` file defines a [DynamoDB][ddb] table with two named [Global Secondary Indexes][gsi], both with `projection` explicitly defined:

<arc-viewer default-tab=arc>
<div slot=contents>
<arc-tab label=arc>
<h5>arc</h5>
<div slot=content>

```arc
@app
testapp

@tables
accounts
  accountID *String

@tables-indexes
accounts
  email *String
  projection keys # only project base table and index keys (in this example that would be accountID and email)
  name byEmail

accounts
  created *String
  projection updated lastAccessed # only project base table and index keys plus the updated and lastAccessed attributes
  name byDate
```
</div>
</arc-tab>

<arc-tab label=json>
<h5>json</h5>
<div slot=content>

```json
{
  "app": "testapp",
  "tables": [
    { "accounts": { "accountID": "*String" } }
  ],
  "indexes": [
    { "accounts": { "email": "*String", "name": "byEmail", "projection": "keys" } },
    { "accounts": { "created": "*String", "name": "byDate", "projection": [ "updated", "lastAccessed" ] } }
  ]
}
```
</div>
</arc-tab>

<arc-tab label=yaml>
<h5>yaml</h5>
<div slot=content>

```yaml
