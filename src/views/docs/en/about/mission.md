Architect is on a mission to free web apps dev from infrastructure complexity and vendor cruft. Our goal is to let you focus on the core business logic required to create value, ship only the code that matters, iterate faster and enjoy unprecedented availability guarantees.

## Principles

- Focus on defining app architecture with clear generic language in plain text
- Generated code must work locally and totally offline
- Code must be deployed and extended with standard CloudFormation templates
- The format, parser, and tooling are also all completely open to extension

> The Architect manifest is entirely portable between cloud vendors however no ports to clouds other than AWS have been made as of today
