# `npx env`

Read and write environment variables that are made immediately available to all deployed Lambda functions. Sensitive configuration data, such as API keys, needs to happen _outside_ of the codebase in revision control and you can use this tool to ensure an entire team and the deployment targets are in sync. 

## Example Usage

- `npx env` displays environment variables for the current `.arc`
- `npx env staging FOOBAZ somevalue` writes env variable `FOOBAZ=somevalue` to staging Lambdas
- `npx env remove testing FOOBAZ` removes a `testing` env var
- `npx env verify` display a report of Lambdas and their env variables

Things to note

- Adding and removing variables automatically syncs all lambdas and the current working directory `.arc-env`
- `NODE_ENV`, `ARC_APP_NAME` and `SESSION_TABLE_NAME` are reserved
- There is no performance impact to your app; these variables are synchronized every write and immediately available to all Lambdas defined by the current `.arc` file

> Currently `.arc` uses AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as a centralized backing storage mechanism for app environment variables. [Read more about AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html)

## The `.arc-env` File

This file **should not** be commited into your project git repository.

- Generated by adding or removing env vars using `npx env`
- Automatically read by `arc-sandbox` and populates `process.env` when `npx sandbox` runs locally
- Lists env vars for `testing` or `staging` for local dev

This is an example file:

```arc
# example .arc-env
@testing 
GLOBAL asdfasdf

@staging
GLOBAL_KEY val
```
