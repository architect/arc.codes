# Logging & Monitoring

> Instant access to clean, readable logs is super important; `arc` relies primarily on AWS's standard means of logging: CloudWatch

- Good old fashioned `console.log` will show up in [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
- CloudWatch events offers a ton of metrics
- [X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) offers deeper service call introspection capabilities
- There are many third party tools to further extend your app with structured logs
